Hello guys!

Today, I'm excited to release my simple app, Salawati | ØµÙ„ÙˆØ§ØªÙŠ ðŸ“±âœ¨.

This app provides Islamic prayer times ðŸ¤² 

and calculates the remaining time until the next prayer.

I used the flutter_screenutil package to make the UI responsive.

For fetching prayer times, I used the AlAdhan API.

I'm really happy with the result, and hopefully, the next projects will be even better! ðŸš€
